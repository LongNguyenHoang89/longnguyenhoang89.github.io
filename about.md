My name is `Long`, although I often use `Eledra` as an unique nick name in all video games that I play. 

I am currently at my 2nd year of my PhD at `Laboratoire Lorrain De Recherche En Informatique Et Ses Applications` (LORIA). My lab is a joint research unit of `CNRS`, the `University of Lorraine` and `INRIA` at Nancy, France. My main research topic is security for real-time peer-to-peer collaborative editing. Which can roughly expressed as how to secure a `Google docs` tool but using a peer-to-peer architecture (Check out [MUTE](https://github.com/coast-team/mute)).

I received my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from `FPT University` Vietnam in 2011. I spent some time working for `FPT Software` Vietnam as a developer before getting admited to `Aalto University`, Finland, for a master degree in `Mobile computing - Service and Security`. 

I am interested, and also has somewhat limited experience, in information security in general, applied cryptography and blockchain technology. I am also an enthusiastic about software architecture design and hackathons - which I attended, and sometimes won, a handful of events.

For my complete CV, please take a look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eledra/) or email me directly.

My leisure time activities includes, but not limited to, playing Dota2, RPGs, reading fantasy novels, watching culinary art videos and thriller movies.
