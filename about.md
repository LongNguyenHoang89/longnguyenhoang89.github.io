My name is `Long`, although I often go by `Eledra` as a unique nick name in all video games that I play. 

I am currently in my 3rd year of my PhD at `Laboratoire Lorrain De Recherche En Informatique Et Ses Applications` (LORIA). My lab is a joint research unit of `CNRS`, the `University of Lorraine` and `INRIA` at Nancy, France. My main research topic is security for real-time peer-to-peer collaborative editing, which can roughly expressed as how to secure a French version of `Google docs` using a peer-to-peer architecture (Check out [MUTE](https://github.com/coast-team/mute)).

I received my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from `FPT University` Vietnam in 2011. I spent some time working for `FPT Software` Vietnam as a developer before getting admitted to `Aalto University`, Finland, for a master degree in `Mobile computing - Service and Security`. My master thesis is [Securely accessing encrypted cloud storage from multiple devices](https://ssg.aalto.fi/projects/omnishare/), supervised by Professor N.Asokan. We won the first prize of the European [Privacy via IT Security: Innovating Mobile App Competition](https://mappingtheinternet.eu/Privacy-via-IT-Security-Innovating-Mobile-App-Competition-is-launched).

I am interested, and has also somewhat limited experience, in information security in general, applied cryptography and blockchain technology. I am also an enthusiastic about software architecture design and hackathons - which I regularly attend, and sometimes won.

My leisure-time activities include, but not limited to, playing Dota2, RPGs, reading fantasy novels, watching culinary art videos and thriller movies.
