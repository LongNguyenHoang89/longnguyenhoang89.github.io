I am currently at my 2nd year of my PhD at `Laboratoire Lorrain De Recherche En Informatique Et Ses Applications` (LORIA). My lab is a joint research unit of `CNRS`, the `University of Lorraine` and `INRIA` at Nancy, France. My main research topic is security for real-time peer-to-peer collaborative editing. Which can roughly expressed as how to secure a `Google docs` tool but using a peer-to-peer architecture (Check out [MUTE](https://github.com/coast-team/mute)).

I am interested, and also has somewhat limited experience, in information security in general, applied cryptography and blockchain technology.
